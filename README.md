# Interactive Resume with Tooltips

This project is a simple and interactive resume webpage built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features tooltips that appear when hovering over specific skills, providing additional information about the user's expertise in those areas.

## Features

- **Interactive Tooltips**: When hovering over each skill, a tooltip appears providing more detailed information about the skill.
- **Responsive Design**: The resume layout is responsive and adjusts to different screen sizes.
- **Smooth Tooltip Positioning**: Tooltips are positioned dynamically based on the viewport, ensuring they do not overflow off the screen.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the basic structure of the webpage.
- **CSS3**: For styling the webpage, including the tooltip appearance and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: For handling the tooltip functionality and ensuring correct positioning based on the user's interaction.

## Project Structure

```
interactive-resume/
├── index.html         # Main HTML file for the resume structure
├── styles.css         # CSS file for styling the resume and tooltips

```

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/interactive-resume.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd interactive-resume
   ```

3. **Open the `index.html` file in your browser** to view the interactive resume.

## Tooltip Functionality

The tooltip feature is implemented using JavaScript and CSS. Each skill listed under the "Skills" section has a tooltip that appears when you hover over the skill. The tooltip is dynamically positioned to ensure it does not overflow off the screen and is always visible.

### Example of Tooltip HTML Structure

```html
<li data-tooltip="Experience with HTML5 and CSS3">HTML/CSS</li>
```

### Tooltip JavaScript Logic

The JavaScript code listens for mouseover and mouseout events on each skill item. It creates and positions the tooltip above or below the skill based on available space and ensures it is centered horizontally.

### Tooltip CSS Styling

```css
.tooltip {
    position: absolute;
    background-color: #333;
    color: #fff;
    padding: 5px 10px;
    border-radius: 5px;
    font-size: 0.8em;
    z-index: 1000;
    opacity: 0;
    transition: opacity 0.3s ease-in-out;
}

.tooltip.visible {
    opacity: 1;
}
```
